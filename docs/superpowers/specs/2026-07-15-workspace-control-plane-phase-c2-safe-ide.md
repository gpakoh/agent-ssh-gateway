# Phase C2 — Safe IDE Workflow

> **Date:** 2026-07-15
> **Status:** Final — ADR decisions closed, ready for implementation
> **Depends on:** Phase C1 (write/edit/patch tools), Phase B (git tools), Phase A (project registry)
> **Audience:** Agent 2 (Receipt Storage & In-Memory Cap), Agent 3 (Rollback/Snapshot/Cleanup), Agent 4 (Audit & CI Hardening)

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Phase C1 gave the agent raw write/edit/patch — but no safety net. The agent writes a file and trusts it worked. The agent edits a file and has no receipt of what changed. The agent patches a file and cannot undo.

Phase C2 wraps every mutation in a **safe IDE workflow**:

```
preview → apply → receipt → verify → (commit | rollback)
```

Every write/edit/patch operation now returns a **ChangeReceipt** that captures before/after content hashes, diff summary, verification status, and the original content for rollback. The agent can inspect a preview before applying, verify the file was written correctly after apply, and roll back to the previous state if verification fails.

New C2 tools default to `safe=True`; C1 callers that pass `safe=False` get the exact C1 response unchanged. The `workspace:snapshot` scope controls snapshot operations, and `project:rollback` controls rollback operations separately from `project:write`.

---

## 2. Core Concepts

### 2.1 Change Receipt

A dataclass/dict returned by every C2 write/edit/patch operation when `safe=true`. Contains full before/after fingerprint:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class ChangeReceipt:
    project_id: str
    path: str                    # project-relative
    relative_path: str           # alias
    operation: Literal["write", "edit", "patch"]

    # Before
    file_exists_before: bool
    size_before: int | None
    sha256_before: str | None

    # After
    size_after: int
    sha256_after: str
    encoding: str                # always "utf-8"

    # Verify (read-back comparison)
    verified: bool               # read_back.sha256 == sha256_after
    read_back_duration_ms: int

    # Audit
    timestamp: str               # ISO-8601
    identity_name: str | None
    identity_token_type: str | None

    # Rollback
    rollback_content: str | None  # original content; None if file was new
```

### 2.2 Snapshot

A point-in-time copy of a file stored in `{project_root}/.ssh-gateway-snapshots/{path}.{timestamp}.snap`. Used only when rollback via in-memory content is insufficient (e.g., file was already modified by another operation).

Only the last snapshot per file is kept (circular: rotate on new snapshot, keep at most 1 per file path + 10 total per project). A global memory byte cap limits total in-memory rollback_content across all receipts; when exceeded, the oldest receipt is evicted (LRU).

### 2.3 Rollback Policy

Rollback restores `rollback_content` from the most recent ChangeReceipt for a given path. If the receipt is from a different session or the file was modified externally, rollback is rejected with `STALE_SNAPSHOT`.

Rollback does NOT traverse symlinks, does NOT create directories, does NOT write to hidden paths.

### 2.4 Audit Trail

Every C2 operation (preview, apply, verify, rollback, snapshot) appends an entry to the gateway-level audit trail. The audit trail is an append-only JSON lines file at `{data_dir}/.ssh-gateway-audit/operations.jsonl` where `data_dir` is the configured gateway data directory (e.g. `/var/lib/ssh-gateway` or `./data`).

Each audit line **excludes** file content, patch body, old_string, new_string, and rollback_content — only metadata is recorded:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-07-15T12:00:00Z",
  "operation": "write",
  "project_id": "my-project",
  "path": "src/main.py",
  "sha256_before": "abc...",
  "sha256_after": "def...",
  "verified": true,
  "identity": {"name": "agent", "type": "agent", "fp_prefix": "a1b2c3d4e5f6"},
  "session_id": "sess_xxx"
}
```

The audit trail is persistent (survives gateway restart).

---

## 3. API Contracts

### 3.1 Preview

Preview shows what a write/edit/patch would do **without making any changes**.

#### `project_file_preview`

```python
def project_file_preview(
    project_id: str,
    relative_path: str,
    operation: Literal["write", "edit", "patch"],
    content: str | None = None,     # for write
    old_string: str | None = None,   # for edit
    new_string: str | None = None,   # for edit
    patch: str | None = None,        # for patch
    registry: WorkspaceRegistry | None = None,
) -> ChangePreview:
```

**Returns:**

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class ChangePreview:
    project_id: str
    path: str
    operation: str

    # Current state
    file_exists: bool
    size_before: int | None
    sha256_before: str | None

    # Predicted after
    size_after: int | None
    sha256_after: str | None

    # Diff
    diff: str                      # unified diff or empty

    # Warnings
    warnings: list[str]            # binary, size threshold, hidden path
    can_apply: bool                # false if policy would block
    policy_blocked_by: str | None  # "symlink", "traversal", "hidden", "scope", None
```

**Important:** Preview computes the before state (reads the file) and predicts the after state (applies the operation in memory), but does **not** write anything. The `diff` field uses `_make_diff` from C1.

#### `project_file_preview` Implementation Rules

1. Validate path against policy first — if traversal/symlink, return `can_apply=False` with `policy_blocked_by` set, do NOT raise.
2. Read current file content; if file does not exist, `file_exists=False`, `size_before=None`, `sha256_before=None`.
3. Apply operation in memory:
   - **write**: use new content directly
   - **edit**: replace old_string with new_string in current content
   - **patch**: apply unified diff to current content
4. Compute `sha256_after` from predicted content.
5. Return diff between current and predicted content.
6. Check for warnings: binary content, size > `max_bytes`, path is hidden/secret.
7. Never write, never create directories, never snapshot.

### 3.2 Safe Apply (Write / Edit / Patch)

The existing C1 `project_file_write`, `project_file_edit`, `project_file_apply_patch` functions get a **new optional parameter** `safe: bool = True`.

- When `safe=True` (default for C2): follow the safe workflow and return a full `ChangeReceipt`.
- When `safe=False`: return the existing C1 dict unchanged — **no breaking change** for callers that depend on the exact C1 response shape.

Safe workflow:

1. **Before snapshot:** if file exists, read current content + compute `sha256_before` + store `rollback_content`.
2. **Apply:** run the existing C1 operation (preserves all current validation).
3. **Read-back verify:** Re-read the file from disk. If `read_back.sha256 == sha256_after`, `verified=True`.
4. **Receipt:** Build and return a `ChangeReceipt` dict.

#### Response Shape for `safe=True`

```json
{
  "project_id": "my-project",
  "path": "src/main.py",

  "operation": "write",

  "file_exists_before": true,
  "size_before": 1024,
  "sha256_before": "abc123...",

  "size_after": 2048,
  "sha256_after": "def456...",
  "encoding": "utf-8",

  "verified": true,
  "read_back_duration_ms": 2,

  "timestamp": "2026-07-15T12:00:00Z",
  "identity_name": "agent",
  "identity_token_type": "agent",

  "rollback_content": "print('hello world')\n",
  "diff": "@@ -1 +1 @@\n-print('hello world')\n+print('goodbye world')\n"
}
```

The C1-only fields (`size`, `path`, `project_id`, `encoding`, `diff`, `replaced`, `applied`, `backup_hash`) remain present for backward compatibility. New C2 fields are additive.

### 3.3 ChangeReceipt Helpers

```python
# Reconstructed from the receipt dict
class ChangeReceipt:
    ...

    def can_rollback(self) -> bool:
        """True if rollback_content is available (file existed before)."""

    def is_verified(self) -> bool:
        """True if read-back hash matches after hash."""

    def to_audit_line(self) -> dict:
        """Summary for audit log (excludes rollback_content, diff)."""
```

### 3.4 Verify

```python
def project_file_verify(
    project_id: str,
    relative_path: str,
    receipt: dict,             # the ChangeReceipt dict
    registry: WorkspaceRegistry | None = None,
) -> dict:
```

Returns `{"path": ..., "verified": bool, "current_sha256": str, "expected_sha256": str, "receipt_timestamp": ...}`.

Re-reads the file from disk and compares its sha256 against the receipt's `sha256_after`. Also checks that the file exists (if receipt said it should) or does not exist (if receipt said it was a new file).

### 3.5 Rollback

```python
def project_file_rollback(
    project_id: str,
    relative_path: str,
    receipt: dict,             # the ChangeReceipt dict from a previous apply
    registry: WorkspaceRegistry | None = None,
) -> dict:
```

**Rollback Policy:**

1. Validate path against policy (reject traversal, symlink, hidden).
2. Check `receipt.rollback_content` is present — if `None` (file did not exist before), rollback = delete the file.
3. Check **staleness**: read the current file's sha256. If `current_sha256 != receipt.sha256_after`, reject with `STALE_SNAPSHOT` — the file was modified after the receipt was created.
4. **Before-rollback snapshot:** save the current (post-apply) content as a snapshot before overwriting.
5. Write `rollback_content` using `_atomic_write`.
6. Read-back verify: confirm sha256 matches `receipt.sha256_before`.
7. Return a rollback receipt:

```json
{
  "path": "src/main.py",
  "rolled_back": true,
  "sha256_before_rollback": "def456...",
  "sha256_after_rollback": "abc123...",
  "verified": true,
  "snapshot_path": ".ssh-gateway-snapshots/src/main.py.2026-07-15T12-05-00Z.snap"
}
```

### 3.6 Snapshot (Direct)

```python
def project_file_snapshot(
    project_id: str,
    relative_path: str,
    registry: WorkspaceRegistry | None = None,
) -> dict:
```

Creates a snapshot of the current file state without any mutation. Returns `{"path": ..., "snapshot_path": ..., "sha256": ..., "timestamp": ...}`.

Used for manual checkpointing by the agent.

### 3.7 Snapshot List

```python
def project_list_snapshots(
    project_id: str,
    relative_path: str | None = None,
    registry: WorkspaceRegistry | None = None,
) -> list[dict]:
```

Returns all snapshots for a project (or a specific file). Each entry has `path`, `snapshot_path`, `sha256`, `timestamp`, `size`.

### 3.8 Audit Query

```python
def project_get_audit(
    project_id: str,
    path: str | None = None,
    limit: int = 50,
    registry: WorkspaceRegistry | None = None,
) -> list[dict]:
```

Returns audit trail entries, most recent first. Supports filtering by path.

## 5. MCP Surface

Three new MCP tools:

| Tool | Scope | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `workspace_file_preview` | `project:write` | Preview without writing |
| `workspace_file_verify` | `project:read` | Verify a receipt |
| `workspace_file_rollback` | `project:rollback` | Rollback by receipt |

Existing `workspace_file_write`, `workspace_file_edit`, `workspace_apply_patch` gain an optional `safe` parameter (default `true`). When `safe=True`, the response includes the full ChangeReceipt. Pass `safe=False` to get the exact C1 response shape.

---

## 6. SDK Surface

```python
# Preview
gateway.workspace_file_preview(project_id, path, operation="write", content="...")

# Safe apply (returns receipt)
receipt = gateway.workspace_file_write(project_id, path, content, safe=True)

# Verify
verify_result = gateway.workspace_file_verify(project_id, path, receipt)

# Rollback
rollback_result = gateway.workspace_file_rollback(project_id, path, receipt)

# Audit
audit = gateway.workspace_get_audit(project_id, path="src/main.py", limit=10)
```

The SDK helper `ChangeReceipt` class provides `.can_rollback()`, `.is_verified()`, `.to_audit_line()`.

---

## 7. Receipt Storage

Receipts are **memory-only** in C2. The caller (agent, SDK) must keep the receipt dict if they want to verify or rollback later. Receipts are evicted on gateway restart or when a global memory byte cap is exceeded (LRU eviction, oldest first). The memory cap is configurable via `RECEIPT_MEMORY_CAP_BYTES` (default 64 MiB).

PostgreSQL-backed receipt persistence is deferred to Phase D.

The audit trail is always persisted (JSON lines file, append-only). The audit trail survives gateway restarts.

---

## 8. Security & Threat Model

### 8.1 Receipt Trust

The receipt is generated server-side and signed only by the content hash. The caller trusts the receipt because it came from the server. If the caller loses the receipt, rollback is impossible — there is no "admin undo" API.

**Risk:** A compromised agent token could forge a receipt with a fake `sha256_before` to trick rollback into restoring arbitrary content.
**Mitigation:** Rollback always re-reads the current file and checks `current_sha256 == receipt.sha256_after` before restoring. This ensures the file state matches what the receipt describes. If the receipt's `sha256_after` does not match the current file, rollback is rejected. This makes receipt forgery useless for rollback attacks — the attacker would need to also modify the current file to match the forged receipt's `sha256_after`, at which point they already have write access.

### 8.2 Rollback Staleness

If the file was modified (by another agent, another session, or manually) after the receipt was issued, rollback is rejected. This prevents accidental overwrites of newer changes.

### 8.3 Rollback Path Safety

Rollback re-validates the path through `WorkspacePolicy.validate_write` before writing. Symlink escape, traversal, and hidden path checks apply.

### 8.4 Snapshot Security

Snapshots are stored inside the project directory (under `.ssh-gateway-snapshots/`) and inherit the project's secret path filtering. The `.ssh-gateway-snapshots/` directory is added to the secret path patterns list so it is not visible in tree/file listings.

The audit trail is stored at gateway level (`{data_dir}/.ssh-gateway-audit/`) — outside any project directory — so it cannot be tampered with from within a project.

### 8.5 Audit Integrity

The audit trail is append-only JSON lines. No deletion or modification of past entries. If disk fills up, audit logging degrades gracefully (log warning, skip write).

### 8.6 Content Leak Prevention

- The receipt's `rollback_content` field contains the **original** file content. The caller already has this content (they provided the new content), so no new information is leaked.
- The receipt's `diff` field is computed server-side from the before/after content.
- The audit trail excludes `rollback_content` and diff to keep it compact.

### 8.7 Race Conditions

Between "before snapshot" and "apply", another agent could modify the file. The read-back verify step catches this: if `verified=False`, the caller knows the file state does not match expectations. They can retry or investigate.

Rollback detects this via the staleness check (current sha256 vs receipt's sha256_after).

### 8.8 Denial of Service

- Snapshot file storage: max 1 snapshot per file path, max 10 snapshots per project.
- In-memory receipt storage: bounded by a global memory byte cap (configurable via `RECEIPT_MEMORY_CAP_BYTES`, default 64 MiB). When the cap is exceeded, the oldest receipt is evicted (LRU). This prevents unbounded memory growth from large rollback_content payloads.
- Snapshot file size: max `max_bytes` per file (same limit as C1 writes).
- Audit log is bounded by `limit` on query; log rotation is deferred to Phase D.

## 9. Implementation Tasks (for Session 2+)

### 9.1 Core: `app/workspace/receipts.py` (new)

- `ChangeReceipt` dataclass
- `ChangePreview` dataclass
- `compute_sha256(content: str) -> str`
- `read_before_state(path: Path) -> dict` — returns `{exists, size, sha256}`
- `verify_read_back(path: Path, expected_sha256: str) -> dict` — re-reads file, returns `{verified, sha256, duration_ms}`
- `build_receipt(...)` — constructs the receipt dict
- In-memory receipt store with LRU eviction and `RECEIPT_MEMORY_CAP_BYTES` cap
- `evict_oldest()` called on each new receipt when cap exceeded

**Tests:** `tests/test_workspace_receipts.py` — hash computation, before/after state, read-back verify on real files, memory cap eviction.

### 9.2 Core: `app/workspace/snapshot.py` (new)

- `save_snapshot(project_root, relative_path) -> dict`
- `list_snapshots(project_root, relative_path) -> list`
- `load_snapshot_content(project_root, snapshot_path) -> str`

**Snapshots stored at:** `{project_root}/.ssh-gateway-snapshots/{path_slug}.{timestamp}.snap`

**Secrets path pattern added:** `".ssh-gateway-snapshots"` to `VENDOR_CACHE_PATTERNS` or `SECRET_PATH_PATTERNS` in policy.

**Tests:** `tests/test_workspace_snapshot.py` — create snapshot, verify content, list, cleanup.

### 9.3 Core: `app/workspace/audit.py` (new)

- `write_audit_entry(data_dir: Path, entry: dict) -> None`
- `query_audit(data_dir: Path, path=None, limit=50) -> list[dict]`
- `_ensure_audit_dir(data_dir: Path) -> Path`
- Thread-safe append via `open(path, "a")`
- Entry builder excludes `rollback_content`, `diff`, `patch`, `old_string`, `new_string`

**Tests:** `tests/test_workspace_audit.py` — write entries, query by path, verify ordering, verify no content fields leaked.

### 9.4 Core: Modify `app/workspace/edit.py`

- Add `safe: bool = True` parameter to `project_file_write`, `project_file_edit`, `project_apply_patch`.
- When `safe=True` (default): snapshot before, compute receipt, read-back verify, return receipt.
- When `safe=False`: return existing C1 dict (no change).

### 9.5 REST: Modify `app/routers/workspace.py`

- Accept `safe` in request body for write/edit/patch endpoints.
- Add preview/verify/rollback endpoints.
- Add snapshot/snapshots/audit endpoints.

### 9.6 Auth: Add `workspace:snapshot` and `project:rollback` scopes

- Add `"workspace:snapshot"` and `"project:rollback"` to `VALID_AGENT_SCOPES` and `ALL_SCOPES`.
- `project_file_rollback` requires `project:rollback` scope.
- `project_file_snapshot` requires `workspace:snapshot` scope.

### 9.7 Tests: `tests/test_workspace_receipts.py`, `tests/test_workspace_snapshot.py`, `tests/test_workspace_audit.py`

- Unit tests for each module.
- Integration tests for safe apply → verify → rollback cycle.
- Security tests for rollback staleness, path safety, snapshot bounds.

## 10. ADR Decisions

All open decisions from the initial draft are closed as follows:

| # | Question | ADR |
|---|----------|-----|
| 1 | Receipt storage | **Memory-only in C2.** PostgreSQL-backed persistence deferred to Phase D. Receipts evicted on restart or when `RECEIPT_MEMORY_CAP_BYTES` (default 64 MiB) is exceeded (LRU). |
| 2 | Audit format | **JSONL.** File content, patch body, old_string, new_string, and rollback_content are explicitly excluded — metadata only (hashes, identity, operation, path, verified status). |
| 3 | Audit location | **Gateway-level data dir**, not inside project. Path: `{data_dir}/.ssh-gateway-audit/operations.jsonl`. This prevents tampering from within a project. |
| 4 | Snapshot caps | **10 per project, 1 latest per file, global memory byte cap required** (see #1). File snapshots are on-disk; rollback_content is in-memory receipts. |
| 5 | Rollback scope | **Separate scopes.** `project:rollback` for rollback operations, `workspace:snapshot` for snapshot operations. Not just `project:write`. |
| 6 | Safe mode default | **`safe=True` for new C2 tools.** Existing C1 callers pass `safe=False` for unchanged response shape. |
| 7 | Retention | **Memory receipts**: evicted on restart or TTL (implicit via memory cap LRU). **Audit JSONL**: persistent (survives restart). Log rotation deferred to Phase D. |

---

## 11. Compatibility with C1

- **No breaking changes:** C1 API unchanged when `safe=False`.
- **No removed fields:** C1 response fields remain in C2-safe response.
- **No new dependencies:** C2 uses only stdlib (`hashlib`, `json`, `time`).
- **Existing tests continue to pass:** C1 tests call without `safe`, get C1 response.
- **Existing MCP tools unchanged:** `workspace_file_write` without `safe` returns current dict.
